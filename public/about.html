<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Namit Kabra, a cuber and the founder of CubeIt.com studying at the victorious kidss educares in Pune, Maharashtra, India. 
  Cubing has always been my passion, hobby and my pastime. I also have participated in various wca (world cube association) 
  and cfi (cube federation of India) competitions. To be honest, even I am still a learner and Im learning from various big cubers 
  such as J perm, Z3 cubing, Blegend, etc. I would always want to achieve something big in cubing which is also my biggest dream. 
  I hope this website will help out you in learning various types of rubix cubes. </p>
